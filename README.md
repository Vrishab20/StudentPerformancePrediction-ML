# StudentPerformancePrediction-ML
This is a simple machine learning project using classifiers for predicting factors that affect student grades, using data from a CSV file


In this Project, a dataset that has students from nationalities, and different grade levels, and also some determining factors like,
number of hands raised, number of attendances, number of hours studied, etc. is used, which is a CSV File.


A few different classifiers and ML models have been used to get the most accurate predictions of which factors,
affect the marks of students.

A few visual aids like graphs and confusion matrix have been created, to show the results.
